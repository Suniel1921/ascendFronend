            If you're not incorporated, your business may not appear as
            professional as you want it to. Incorporating helps protect your
            personal assets, provides tax advantages, and can help grow your
            business.

            What Does It Mean To Be Incorporated?
          </h2>
          <p className="benefits_paragraph">
            Incorporation is the process of legally defining your business. Just
            like you wouldn't build a house without a plan, you shouldn't build
            a business without proper structure. Choosing an LLC, S Corporation,
            or C Corporation gives you the flexibility to decide on a tax
            structure that works best for your business.
