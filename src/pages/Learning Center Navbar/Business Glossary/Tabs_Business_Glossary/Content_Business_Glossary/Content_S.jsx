            <p>
                A corporation granted a special tax status as specified under the Internal Revenue Code. The code is very explicit on how and when this election is made and the number of shareholders this type of corporation can have. Since this type of corporation pays no income tax, all gains and losses of the corporation pass through to the individual shareholders in proportion to their holdings.

            <p><b>Selective Incorporation</b></p>
            <p>
                Selective incorporation is a doctrine that states that the Bill of Rights protect and apply to the states and that the states cannot create laws that deny the rights of American citizens as stated in the Bill of Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it applies to business, states may be able to grant businesses a monopoly on the basis that it is not explicitly prohibited by the Constitution. Subsequent Supreme Court rulings have limited the abilities of states to create laws to limit or deny the rights and privileges of citizens as granted by the Constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selective incorporation is also known as the incorporation doctrine.
            </p>
            <p>
                While related, selective incorporation is separate from total incorporation. Please see total incorporation definition to compare and contrast the two terms.
