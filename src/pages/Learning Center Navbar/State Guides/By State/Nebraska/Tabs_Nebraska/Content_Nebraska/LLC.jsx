      <h2>Forming an LLC in Nebraska</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of requirements for businesses that plan on
        forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) there. If you decide to form
        an LLC in Nebraska, incorporate.com will take care of all the details.
        We'll research the availability of your company name and help you
        prepare and file your Certificate of Organization with the Nebraska
        Secretary of State. We can also take care of many of your company's
        follow-up needs, including annual report preparation and filing.

      <h2>LLC Name Requirements</h2>

        registered with the Secretary of State. When you form your LLC with
        incorporate.com's help, we'll research your company name to make sure it
        meets Nebraska's standards.
