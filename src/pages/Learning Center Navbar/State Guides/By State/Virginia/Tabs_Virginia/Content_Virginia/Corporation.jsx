      <h3>Steps to Incorporate</h3>

      <h4>Select a Business Name</h4>
      <p>
        The first step to incorporating in Virginia is to select an original
        business name not already in use or reserved by another business in the
        state. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The name of your company must be written in English letters or Arabic
          or Roman numerals.
        </li>
        <li>
          The company name may include any of the following punctuation marks or
          symbols: periods, commas, colons, semi-colons, apostrophes, round
          parentheses, dashes, minus signs, plus signs, equals signs, question
          marks, exclamation points, and @, #, $, %, &, and *. No other letters,
          numbers or marks are acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name must include the word "company," "corporation,"
          "incorporated," or "limited," or the abbreviation "Co.," "Corp.,"
          "Inc." or "Ltd."
        </li>
        <li>
          The name may not contain language stating or implying that the
          corporation is organized for a purpose other than that indicated on
          its articles of organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of a corporation may not imply that it is or will be
          conducting business as a bank, trust company, insurance company, or
          public service company, such as a railroad, telephone company,
          utility, or water or sewer company, unless it will actually be engaged
          in such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          No business entity's name may include the word "bank" or "trust"
          unless it will be engaged in the banking or trust company business, or
          it is clear from the context of the remaining words that it will not
          be engaged in such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          No business entity's name may include the word or words "engineer,"
          "architecture" or "land surveying," or any modification or derivation
          of such words, unless the entity will be lawfully engaged in such
          services or it is clear from the context of the remaining words that
          the entity will not conduct such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          The words "United States," "national," "Federal" and "reserve" may not
          be included in the name of a business entity that is engaged in the
          banking, loan, building and loan, brokerage, factorage, insurance,
          indemnity, savings or trust business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>ascendincorporate.com</strong> will do the necessary research to make
        sure your company's name meets Virginia state standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        When incorporating in Virginia, you can reserve a corporate name for 120
        days for a fee of $10.00. You can renew the reservation for successive
        periods of 120 days, as long as you renew during the 45-day period
        before the reservation expires.
      </p>

      <h4>File Articles of Incorporation</h4>
      <p>
        Once we have verified your company name,{" "}
        <strong>ascendincorporate.com</strong> will file your Articles of
        Incorporation with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The filing
        includes the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Corporate information:</strong> The exact corporate name,
          including abbreviations and punctuation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stock:</strong> The total number of shares your company is
          authorized to issue. (Note: the charter fee and annual registration
          fee are based on the number of authorized shares.) If more than one
          class or series of shares is to be authorized, the articles must state
          the number of each class of stock that the corporation is authorized
          to issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registered Office and Agent:</strong> The name, street address
          and county (or independent city) of a registered agent in Virginia.
          The registered agent is the person to whom the state will send all
          official correspondence. Under Virginia law, your company cannot serve
          as its own registered agent. You will be required to indicate why the
          designated person or company is qualified to be your registered agent.
          It must be an individual who is a resident of Virginia and either an
          initial director of the corporation or a member of the Virginia State
          Bar; or a domestic or foreign company authorized to do business in
          Virginia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Directors:</strong> If your registered agent's
          qualification is that s/he is an initial director of your corporation,
          then you must include the names and addresses of all initial directors
          in the articles of incorporation. A corporation can have directors
          immediately upon formation only if they are named in the articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorporators:</strong> Your articles must be signed by one or
          more incorporators and the printed name of the incorporator must
          appear next to the signature.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Pay Filing Fee</h4>
      <p>
        Virginia requires companies incorporating to pay a filing fee of $25 and
        a charter fee. The charter fee amount depends on the number of
        authorized shares. For one million or fewer shares, you pay $50 for each
        25 thousand shares or fraction thereof. If you authorize more than one
        million shares, it is a flat fee of $2,500.
      </p>
      <p>
        Filings can take 3 to 12 days to process. Expedited service is available
        for an additional fee.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>Other Requirements for Corporations</h3>
      <h4>Register with the IRS and the Virginia Department of Taxation</h4>
      <p>
        If you intend to hire employees or open a bank account, you will need a
        federal Employer Identification Number (EIN).{" "}
        <strong>incorporate.com</strong> can help expedite this step as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should then register your business with the Virginia Department of
        Taxation. You can register online using the VATAX online services or by
        completing registration form R-1. Once you have registered, you will be
        assigned a Virginia Tax account number, which you should include on tax
        returns, payments and other tax filings. If your business will be
        collecting sales tax, you will be issued a certificate of registration,
        which is your permit to collect sales tax, and issue and receive tax
        exemption certificates. Your certificate of registration should be
        displayed prominently in your physical place of business.
      </p>

      <h4>Officers/Directors</h4>
      <p>
        If you choose to incorporate in Virginia, your company must have at
        least one director.
      </p>

      <h4>Annual Reports</h4>
      <p>
        Every Virginia corporation must file an annual report with the Office of
        the Clerk of the State Corporation Commission on or before the last day
        of the 12th month after it was incorporated. That day becomes the
        deadline for each annual report thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Virginia allows corporations to file annual reports online or on paper.
        The annual report form is prepopulated with some of your corporate
        information on file in the Office of the Clerk, which can be updated
        when you file your report. There is no filing fee for annual reports.
      </p>

      <h4>Annual Registration Fee</h4>
      <p>
        Virginia requires corporations to pay an annual registration fee based
        on the number of shares they are authorized to issue. (The cost ranges
        from $100 for companies with up to 5,000 shares to $1,700 for companies
        with over 270,000 shares). Payment is due on or before the last day of
        the month in which the company was formed. Late payments will result in
        a penalty of $10 or 10 percent of the annual registration fee, whichever
        is greater. Nonstock companies pay a flat annual registration fee of
        $25.
      </p>

      <h4>Principal Office</h4>
      <p>Your corporation can be located outside of Virginia.</p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <h4>Do I need to reserve a name?</h4>
      <p>
        Virginia does not require name reservation; however, it is a good way to
        ensure that your company name is available, and will remain available
        while you file for incorporation.
      </p>

      <h4>Do I need to submit bylaws?</h4>
      <p>
        No, you won't need to submit bylaws when choosing to incorporate in
        Virginia. Nevertheless, drafting your corporation's bylaws is a critical
        step in forming your company, as they are a blueprint that you will use
        to govern operations.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Does Virginia have publication requirements or other follow-up filings?
      </h4>
      <p>
        No. Virginia does not require you to publicize your company's formation,
        and does not have follow-up filing requirements.
