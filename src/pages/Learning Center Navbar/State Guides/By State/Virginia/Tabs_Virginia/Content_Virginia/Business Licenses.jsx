      <h3>Local Virginia Business Licenses</h3>
      <p>
        Nearly all businesses in Virginia need a local business license, and may
        also need a zoning permit. Business licenses are expedited at the county
        or city level by the Commissioner of Revenue or Department of Finance,
        and zoning permits are handled by the city/county Zoning Office.
      </p>

      <p>
        Virginia business license fees are calculated by gross receipts from any
        one activity, and different cities apply different rates. For example,
        in Richmond, there is no fee for a business license if your gross
        receipts are less than $5,000, and you would pay a flat fee of $30 if
        your gross receipts are between $5,000 and $99,999. After that, the
        amount due is determined by multiplying the gross receipts by the tax
        rate. In Charlottesville, the business license fee is $35 if your gross
        receipts are $50,000 or less, and calculated by the tax rate for
        receipts over $50,000.
      </p>

      <h3>Employee Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        If you have at least one employee, you are required to address the issue
        of employer insurance. Employees also trigger numerous tax requirements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Health Insurance:</strong> The new national health care reform
          law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) requires
          employers to issue a Marketplace Notification to current employees by
          October 1st, 2013, and to new hires within 14 days of the employee's
          start date. The notification is to help employees to better understand
          health insurance marketplaces, compare health insurance plans, and
          enroll in coverage. Virginia did not create a state-specific insurance
          marketplace, opting instead to refer residents to the federal
          HealthCare.gov marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unemployment Insurance:</strong> The Virginia Unemployment
          Compensation Act requires you to contribute to the state's
          unemployment compensation fund, which funds temporary unemployment
          insurance benefits to eligible workers. If you are a general business
          employer with at least one worker in 20 different weeks during a
          calendar year, or with a payroll of at least $1,500 in any calendar
          quarter, you are liable for contributions under the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workers' Compensation Insurance:</strong> If you have three or
          more employees, you must carry workers' compensation insurance with a
          private insurance carrier, have a certificate of self-insurance issued
          by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, or be a member of a
          group self-insurance association approved by the State Corporation
          Commission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payroll Taxes:</strong> You will need to make periodic payroll
          tax payments and/or file quarterly reports about payroll taxes and
          other mandatory deductions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        Your business may be required to pay different taxes in Virginia,
        depending upon your type and size of business. Your tax requirements may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sales and Use Tax:</strong> The sales and use tax is imposed
          at the state and local levels in Virginia. The combined rate is 5
          percent (4.0 percent state and 1.0 percent local). A seller is subject
          to a sales tax imposed on gross receipts derived from retail sales or
          leases of taxable tangible personal property, unless the retail sales
          or leases are specifically exempt by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sales Tax Exemption Certificate:</strong> If your business
          involves selling products, you need a Sales Tax Exemption Certificate.
          It allows you to purchase materials that will become part of the
          product you sell from suppliers without paying taxes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Litter Tax:</strong> If you are a manufacturer, wholesaler,
          distributor, or retailer of certain products, you are required to pay
          a $10 annual litter tax, plus another $15 if you manufacture, sell, or
          distribute groceries, soft drinks, carbonated waters, beer, and other
          malt beverages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Activities subject to litter tax include:
          <ul>
