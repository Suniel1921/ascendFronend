      <h2>Steps to Form an LLC</h2>

      <h3>Select a Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to forming your LLC in Virginia is to select an original
        name not already in use by another business in the state. Here are some
        things to keep in mind when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The name of your company must be written in English letters or Arabic
          or Roman numerals.
        </li>
        <li>
          The company name may include any of the following punctuation marks or
          symbols: periods, commas, colons, semi-colons, apostrophes, round
          parentheses, dashes, minus signs, plus signs, equals signs, question
          marks, exclamation points, and @, #, $, %, &, and *.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of a limited liability company must include the words
          "limited company" or "limited liability company," or the abbreviation
          "LC," "L.C.," "LLC," or "L.L.C."
        </li>
        <li>
          The name may not contain language stating or implying that the
          corporation is organized for a purpose other than that indicated on
          its articles of organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of a corporation may not imply that it is or will be
          conducting business as a bank, trust company, insurance company, or
          public service company, such as a railroad, telephone company,
          utility, or water or sewer company, unless it will actually be engaged
          in such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          No business entity's name may include the word "bank" or "trust"
          unless it will be engaged in the banking or trust company business, or
          it is clear from the context of the remaining words that it will not
          be engaged in such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          No business entity's name may include the word or words "engineer,"
          "architecture," or "land surveying," or any modification or derivation
          of such words, unless the entity will be lawfully engaged in such
          services or it is clear from the context of the remaining words that
          the entity will not conduct such business.
        </li>
        <li>
          The words "United States," "national," "Federal," and "reserve" may
          not be included in the name of a business entity that is engaged in
          the banking, loan, building and loan, brokerage, factorage, insurance,
          indemnity, savings, or trust business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When creating your LLC in Virginia, you can reserve a corporate name for
        120 days for a fee of $10.00. You can renew the reservation for
        successive periods of 120 days, as long as you do so during the 45-day
        period before the reservation expires.

        which is your permit to collect sales tax and issue and receive tax
        exemption certificates. Your certificate of registration should be
