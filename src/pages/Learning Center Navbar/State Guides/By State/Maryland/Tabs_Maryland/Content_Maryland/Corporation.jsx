      <h2>General Maryland Incorporation Information</h2>
      <p>
        Incorporation affords business owners a layer of protection for their
        personal assets in the event a legal claim is levied against the
        business. Additionally, it gives business owners a means to create and
        protect intellectual property. Moreover, incorporation grants business
        owners the opportunity to offer stock options or equity to employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        The State of Maryland also allows professionals to form what is called a
        professional corporation, or a PC. A professional corporation can be
        useful to groups of professionals such as attorneys, physicians, and
        accountants who choose to incorporate their practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporating offers universal advantages. C Corporations and S
        Corporations offer separate, yet distinct advantages for businesses.
        Once you have determined which corporate designation best suits your
        business needs, the incorporation process can begin.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Incorporate in Maryland</h2>
      <p>
        To form a Maryland corporation you will need to create your company's
        articles of incorporation. These articles will cover areas such as
        naming corporate officers, the number of shares your company will issue
        along with their value, and your registered agent.
      </p>

      <h3>Officers</h3>
      <p>
        It is necessary to list all the names and addresses of your company's
        officers listed in your incorporation forms. The State of Maryland
        requires that each corporation has a President, Secretary, and
        Treasurer. Your corporation will need to have at least one director.
        This director does not need to live in the State of Maryland. In
        addition, Maryland does not have any age restrictions for the director
        of your corporation. Each director's address will need to be listed in
        your articles of incorporation.
      </p>

      <h3>Share of Stock</h3>
      <p>
        Once the number of shares has been determined, this number should not be
        changed during the filing process. A change in the number of shares can
        have an effect on filing fees.
      </p>

      <h3>Registered Agent</h3>
      <p>
        The articles of incorporation must list your registered agent's name and
        physical address. The address of your registered agent must be in the
        State of Maryland and cannot be a post office box. It is important to
        have a service provider serve as your company's registered agent rather
        than a business owner or member of their organization serving in this
        capacity.
      </p>

      <h3>Company Name</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, you will need to select a name for your corporation and
        register it with the state. This name cannot already be on file, nor can
        it be too similar to a corporation name already registered in Maryland.
        In addition, the name of your corporation must include either the word
        "Incorporated" or "Corporation," or an abbreviation of these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using parentheses in your company name is not allowed as it is seen as
        having two names for your business. Also, the name may not give the
        impression that the purpose of your corporation is different than what
        is stated in its articles of incorporation.
      </p>
