      <h2>How to Get a Maryland Business License</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to obtaining a business license in Maryland, interested parties
        should contact the county clerk of the municipality where your business
        will be based to determine any zoning requirements. If your business is
        a home-based business, you must find out if your city allows individuals
        to operate businesses from their homes.

        In the event your business decides to hire employees, you must first
        contact the Maryland Division of Employment and Training. This entity
        regulates the unemployment insurance laws that your business will be
        expected to follow. You will need to open a business account with them.
        Finally, the Division of Labor and Industry office has a number of rules
        and regulations that must be abided when doing business within the
        state.
