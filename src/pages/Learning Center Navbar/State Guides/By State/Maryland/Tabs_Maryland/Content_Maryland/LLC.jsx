      <h2>Forming a Maryland LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Forming a Maryland LLC takes considerable planning and preparation.
        incorporate.com can work with you to compile and complete the necessary
        paperwork required.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Maryland LLC can provide your business entity with the legal and
        financial protection not afforded to sole proprietorships or general
        partnerships. Additionally, this sort of business structure limits the
        financial liability of members in the event of legal action.
      </p>

      <h3>General Maryland LLC Information</h3>
      <p>
        An LLC allows you to protect your personal property, such as your home
        or savings account, from liabilities incurred by the LLC. In other
        words, debts and lawsuits cannot spread from your Maryland LLC to your
        personal assets since the LLC is considered a separate entity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are also tax advantages that come with operating as an LLC. For
        instance, under an LLC, health insurance costs for employees can be
        deducted from taxes at the end of each year.
      </p>

      <h3>Forming an LLC in Maryland</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to forming an LLC in Maryland involves selecting and
        registering a business name or "trade name." This name is how your
        business will be known publicly and must be distinct from other business
        names registered within the state.
      </p>

      <p>
        ascendincorporate.com has a list of names restricted in the state of Maryland.
        We can help you research and confirm if your elected business name, or
        one similar to it, is already in use by another Maryland business
        entity. We will contact you if your name has been taken so that you can
        develop a unique name that satisfies the state's requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your LLC will also need its own Articles of Organization. In addition to
        stating the purpose for forming the LLC, Maryland requires the articles
        of organization to include your business name and address, as well as
        the name, address, and signature of your resident agent. According to
        Maryland law, your business must have a physical address and cannot use
        a post office box in lieu of a street address.
      </p>

      <p>
        An operating agreement is optional for LLCs in Maryland, but business
        owners (also called members) are strongly encouraged to prepare one.
        This agreement will outline ownership percentages among LLCs with
        multiple members and define the roles and expectations of each member.
      </p>

      <p>
        incorporate.com can assist with writing and filing your LLC's Articles
        of Organization and operating agreement, as well as procuring a
        registered agent for you in Maryland. While incorporate.com can execute
        same-day formations for some states, we offer 2-hour expedited LLC
