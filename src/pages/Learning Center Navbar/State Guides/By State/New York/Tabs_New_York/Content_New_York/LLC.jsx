      <h2>Forming an LLC in New York</h2>
      <p>
        A New York LLC has several advantages that can help it succeed. An LLC
        in New York State provides greater protection to investors from losing
        more money than they invest. Many companies, therefore, want to create
        LLCs that allow more partners to enter investment opportunities without
        risking excessive financial loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        A business must complete paperwork, secure unregistered names, and pay
        appropriate fees before it can become a limited liability company in New
        York.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Form an LLC in New York</h2>
      <p>
        In order to form a New York LLC, a business must complete Articles of
        Organization and submit them to the New York Secretary of State.
        incorporate.com will submit this on your behalf using the information
        provided to us online. The Articles of Organization must contain the LLC
        Name, the County location, and the LLC's mailing address or registered
        agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        When choosing a name, it is important to find one that has not already
        been registered by another business. incorporate.com will review the
        name that you request and ensure that it is available and complies with
        New York's requirements. This helps to eliminate unexpected delays in
        the company formation process, saving your business time, money, and
        energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        A New York LLC operating agreement is not required by state law but it
        will help define each member's responsibilities for the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically, "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company" follows the
        organization's name. New York LLC filing restricts the use of certain
        words in LLC names. Words such as "legal services," "academy,"
        "education," and "fidelity" are only allowed with the state's
        permission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some words and phrases are completely prohibited. A LLC in New York
        cannot use or include the following words in its business name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>corporation</li>
        <li>state police</li>
        <li>cooperative</li>
        <li>urban development</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For a complete list of restricted and prohibited words, you can contact
        the New York Department of State.
      </p>

      <h2>New York LLC Tax and Fee Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        There are various New York LLC taxes and fee requirements that companies
        must pay. A $20 New York LLC fee is required when submitting the
        Application for Reservation of Name with the Department of State to hold
        the LLC name for 60 days so that no one else can obtain it. If a period
        longer than 60 days is needed, the Department of State may grant up to
        two extensions. Each extension will cost $20.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the $20 New York LLC fee, organizations must also file
        completed Articles of Organization with the New York Department of
        State. This process costs $200. It is absolutely necessary to submit the
        Articles of Organization along with this payment to establish an LLC in
        New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Section 206 of the state's Limited Liability Company Law,
        all LLCs must publish information about their initial Articles of
        Organization in two recognized newspapers. After publication, you must
        send affidavits of publication and $50 to receive a Certificate of
        Publication.
