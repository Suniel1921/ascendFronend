      <h2>Forming an LLC in Oklahoma</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of requirements for businesses that plan on
        forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) there. If you decide to form
        an LLC in Oklahoma, incorporate.com will take care of all the details.
        We'll research the availability of your company name and help you
        prepare and file your Articles of Organization with the Oklahoma
        Secretary of State. We can also take care of many of your company's
        follow-up needs, including annual report preparation and filing.
      </p>

      <h2>LLC Name Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Oklahoma requires Limited Liability Companies to have names that can't
        be confused with the names of any corporations, existing or that have
        existed in the preceding three years, or the names of any LP, LLC, trade
        name, or fictitious name. When you form your LLC with incorporate.com's
        help, we'll research your company name to make sure it meets Oklahoma's
        standards.
