      <h3>General Nevada Incorporation Information</h3>
      <p>
        Prior to incorporating in Nevada, business owners must have a business
        license. While most business licenses are city-, county-, or
        industry-based, Nevada is one of only five U.S. states that require such
        a license for business owners who intend to incorporate. incorporate.com
        can help business owners research the process of obtaining a business
        license. An LLC or Corporation in Nevada is also required to designate a
        Registered Agent. incorporate.com offers Nevada Registered Agent
        services to ensure that all official state and paperwork is forwarded to
        you.

      <h3>Nevada Articles of Incorporation</h3>
      <p>
        Once a business license has been obtained, you will need to create
        articles of incorporation and corporate bylaws. incorporate.com can
        assist your business in writing these articles and bylaws, as well as in
        the process of selecting and registering a unique name for the
        corporation. In Nevada, if the name of a business is a natural person's
        name, the state requires that the business's name be followed by an
        entity indicator such as "Inc.," "LLC," "Limited," "Corporation," or any
        appropriate designation or its abbreviation.

          <strong>Choosing a Corporation Name:</strong> Nevada has certain
          requirements when it comes to the name of your corporation. When
          setting up a Nevada corporation, it is important that the general
          public will not confuse your business name with any name of a
          currently owned limited liability company, business trust,
          corporation, or limited partnership.

          <strong>Restricted Designations:</strong> Certain words are restricted
          and cannot be used with your Nevada company formation unless approved
          by the state. incorporate.com currently holds a list of all restricted
          names and can help you avoid using any of these words or phrases by
          doing the research for you.

          <strong>Officers and Directors:</strong> The director of your
          corporation will need to be a minimum of eighteen years old at the
          time of incorporation. In addition, the address and name of the
          director will need to appear in the Articles of Incorporation for a
          Nevada corporation filing. Nevada is one of several U.S. states that
          require a corporation to have a President, Secretary, and Treasurer.
