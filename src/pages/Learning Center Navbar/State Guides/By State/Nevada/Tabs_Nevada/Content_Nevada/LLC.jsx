      <h2>Forming an LLC in Nevada</h2>
      <p>

        businesses and a wide range of mid-size and small businesses. Regardless

        of forming an LLC in Nevada.
      </p>

      <h2>Advantages and Benefits of Forming a Nevada LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Forming a Nevada LLC has many benefits for the average business owner.
        Nevada does not impose a franchise tax on LLCs, and there are no fees on
        company shares. Additional Nevada LLC advantages include the fact that
        the state does not require business owners, shareholders, or members to
        be Nevada residents. Nevada also allows LLCs to have noneconomic members
        who do not own a portion of the company but still have the same voting
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more benefit of forming a Nevada LLC is that the state does not
        impose a personal income tax or franchise tax on limited liability
        companies in the state.
      </p>

      <h2>General Nevada LLC Formation Information</h2>
      <p>
        Plans for forming an LLC in Nevada begin with choosing a business name.
        This name must be different from other business entities in existence.
        In Nevada, a person cannot use their natural name as the name of their
        company unless that name is appended with either "Limited" or "LLC."
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a name has been selected and registered, LLC members must be
        appointed. Nevada law requires that LLCs have at least one member or
        manager and that all members are 18 years of age or older. Members and
        managers do not have to live in the state of Nevada; however, member
        names must be listed in the LLC's Articles of Organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        ascendincorporate.com can assist you in selecting a company name and
        performing the necessary research to ensure that name is not in use by
        another company. incorporate.com can help with writing and filing the
        new Nevada LLC's Articles of Organization.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Nevada LLC Fees, Filings & Forms</h2>
      <p>
        After your Nevada LLC has been formed, an additional filing is required
        on or before the last day of the first month after filing your
        business's Articles of Organization. A list of LLC managers and members
        is due 30 days after an LLC has been formed in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state also calls for LLCs to submit an annual report each year. The
        fee to file this report in Nevada is $125.
      </p>

      <h2>Compare Nevada vs. Delaware LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Recently, Nevada has become one of the most popular states where
        businesses choose to form an LLC. For years, business owners considered
        Delaware the top choice, but this is changing. Nevada has been working
        on duplicating Delaware's business-friendly attitude to encourage
        business owners to choose Nevada over Delaware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delaware has a strong business court system capable of handling complex
        legal matters. For this reason, Delaware is an attractive option for
        larger business entities, fast-growing companies, or start-up companies
        with potential for fast growth. However, if your LLC has little
        likelihood of fostering any complex legal issues in the future, then a
        Nevada LLC may be a good choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Nevada and Delaware allow for "series LLCs," a unique designation
        that allows companies to further divide and protect a variety of assets
        without having to form additional entities. A series LLC allows for
        multiple members or business lines to be grouped under a common banner.
        Additionally, a series LLC structure can provide businesses with reduced
        costs on filing fees, protection of assets, and multiple business
        purposes collected under a common business name.
