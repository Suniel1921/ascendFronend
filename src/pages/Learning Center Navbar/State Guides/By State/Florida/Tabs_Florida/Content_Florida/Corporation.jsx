      <h3>Certificate of Incorporation in Florida</h3>
      <p>
        In Florida, certificates of incorporation are issued by the Department
        of State's Division of Corporations. While many forms are available
        online, entrepreneurs often find the process confusing due to irrelevant
        information that may not pertain to their specific business type.

        process. We assist in looking up business names, filling out forms,
