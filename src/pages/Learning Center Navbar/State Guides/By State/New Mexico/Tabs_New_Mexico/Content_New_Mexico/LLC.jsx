      <h2>Forming an LLC in New Mexico</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of requirements for businesses that plan on
        forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) there. If you decide to form
        an LLC in New Mexico, incorporate.com will take care of all the details.
        We'll research the availability of your company name and help you
        prepare and file your Articles of Organization with the New Mexico
        Public Regulation Commission. We can also take care of many of your
        company's follow-up needs, including annual report preparation and
        filing.

      <h2>LLC Name Requirements</h2>

        name reserved with the Public Regulation Commission. When you form your
        LLC with incorporate.com's help, we'll research your company name to
