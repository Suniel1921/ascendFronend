      <h2>Get North Dakota Business Licenses</h2>
      <p>
        Before your business can legally begin to operate, you must satisfy its
        license, permit, and tax registration requirements. Almost all state,
        county, and local governments require businesses to obtain one or more
        licenses and permits. Additionally, selling taxable goods and services
        or hiring employees requires that you register with tax authorities. All
        business license, permit, and tax registration requirements vary by your
        industry and location.
