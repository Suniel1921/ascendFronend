      <h2>How to Incorporate in Illinois</h2>
      <p>
        If you decide to incorporate in Illinois, incorporate.com will take care
        of all the details. We'll research the availability of your company name
        and help you prepare and file your Articles of Incorporation with the
        Illinois Secretary of State and pay your initial franchise tax. We can
        also take care of many of your company's follow-up needs, including
        annual report preparation and filing.
      </p>

      <h3>Select a Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to incorporate in Illinois is to select an original name
        not already in use by another business in the state. Illinois requires
        corporations to have names that can't be confused with the names of any
        corporation or LLC in Illinois, assumed corporate or limited liability
        company, not-for-profit, or reserved or registered names.
      </p>

      <h4>Permitted Designations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Co.</li>
        <li>Company</li>
        <li>Corp.</li>
        <li>Corporation</li>
        <li>Inc.</li>
        <li>Incorporated</li>
        <li>Limited</li>
        <li>Ltd.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Restricted Designations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineer</li>
        <li>Engineering</li>

        <li>Bank</li>
        <li>Banker</li>
        <li>Banking</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When the business name is different from the owner's full legal name,
        Illinois' "Assumed Name Act" requires you to register the business name
        with your county clerk's office, regardless of your entity type.
      </p>

      <h3>File Articles of Incorporation</h3>
      <p>
        Once we have verified your company name, incorporate.com will file your
        Articles of Incorporation with the Illinois Secretary of State. The
        filing includes the following information:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Corporation Information:</strong> The name and purpose of the
          corporation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Directors:</strong> Although Illinois requires at least one
          director, their names and addresses are not required in the Articles
          of Incorporation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorporators:</strong> The names, addresses, and signatures
          of all incorporators. (If a corporation acts as an incorporator, the
          name and state of incorporation are listed, and an officer of the
          corporation signs on behalf of the company.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stock:</strong> Details about share class, number of shares
          authorized, proposed shares, consideration to be received, and total
          value. Information on preferences, limitations, and special rights of
          shares is also required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registered Agent:</strong> The name and street address of a
          registered agent in Illinois.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Provisions:</strong> Authorization of preemptive rights,
          denial of cumulative voting, and regulation of internal affairs can be
          attached on a separate sheet.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you intend to hire employees or open a bank account, you will need a
        federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). incorporate.com can help
        expedite this step as well.
      </p>

      <h3>Pay Franchise Tax</h3>
      <p>
        To incorporate in Illinois, the state charges a franchise tax at the
        time of incorporation. The initial franchise tax is assessed at the rate
        of 15/100 of 1 percent ($1.50 per $1,000) on the paid-in capital
        represented in Illinois. The minimum initial franchise tax is $25.
      </p>

      <h3>Register with the Illinois Department of Revenue</h3>
      <p>
        You are required to register your business with the Illinois Department
        of Revenue by completing the REG-1 State of Illinois Business
        Registration Application before you make any purchases, sales, or hire
        employees. Once you have filed your registration, the Department of
        Revenue will issue you a Certificate of Registration, which must be
        displayed in a prominent location at your business.
      </p>

      <p>
        The REG-1 form asks for comprehensive information about your company and
        its activities, including schedules that correspond to specific business
        activities, such as liquor information or cigarette and tobacco products
        information.
      </p>

      <h3>Annual Reports</h3>
      <p>
        Your corporation must file an annual report with the Illinois Secretary
        of State by the first day of the month that marks the anniversary of
        incorporation. The filing fee is $75.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only company officers are authorized to sign annual reports. Emailed or
        faxed signatures are accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need a filing extension, you may apply for an extended filing
        month. This then becomes your anniversary for annual filing, replacing
        the date of your initial Illinois business registration.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you make any changes to issued shares and paid-in capital, you will
        also need to file a Cumulative Report and may have to pay additional
        franchise tax and fees.
      </p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>

      <h4>Do I need to reserve a name?</h4>
      <p>
        Illinois does not require name reservation; however, it is a good way to
        ensure that your company name is available and will remain available
        while you file to incorporate in Illinois.
      </p>

      <h4>
        If I incorporate in Illinois, do I have to locate my principal office in
        the state?
      </h4>
      <p>
        No. Illinois permits a corporation's principal office to be located
        outside of the state.
      </p>

      <h4>Do I need to submit bylaws?</h4>
      <p>
        No, you won't need to submit bylaws. Nevertheless, when considering how
        to incorporate a business in Illinois, drafting your corporation's
        bylaws is a critical step in forming your company, as they are the
        blueprint you will use to govern operations.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Does Illinois have publication requirements or other follow-up filings?
      </h4>
      <p>
        No. You are not required to publicize your Illinois business
        registration, and there are no follow-up filing requirements.
      </p>
