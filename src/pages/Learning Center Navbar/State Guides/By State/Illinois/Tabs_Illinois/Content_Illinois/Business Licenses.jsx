      <h2>State of Illinois Business Licenses and Permits</h2>

      <p>
        Before your business can legally begin to operate, you must satisfy its
        license, permit, and tax registration requirements. Almost all state,
        county, and local governments require businesses to obtain one or more
        licenses and permits. The requirements vary by your industry and
        location.

      <h3>State of Illinois Business Licenses and Permits</h3>

      <p>
        In the State of Illinois, business license application and registration
        is handled by county and local governments. The type of license required
        depends on your place and type of business. Examples of requested
        Illinois business registrations and licenses include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Car Dealer & Remitter Licensing</li>
        <li>Liquor Licenses</li>
        <li>Securities & Loan Business Broker, Dealer, or Advisor Licensing</li>
        <li>
          Grain Warehouses, Dealers, Buyers, & Agricultural Cooperatives
          Licensing
        </li>
        <li>Occupational Licenses and Permits</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Occupational Licenses and Permits</h4>

      <p>
        The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR)
        is the main licensing agency for the State of Illinois for most
        professions and for financial institutions. In addition to standard
        Illinois business licenses, individuals must obtain any occupational
        licenses and permits prior to conducting business. The IDFPR maintains
        an extensive list of professions that require licenses with the
        requirements for each profession. For example, an athletic trainer must
        be able to provide proof of graduation from an approved athletic
        training program, proof of current certification in CPR, and pass a
        state exam in order to become a licensed trainer.
      </p>

      <h4>Environmental Licenses and Permits</h4>

      <p>
        You may need construction or safety permits, or environmental licenses
        for some business activities. The Illinois Department of Environmental
        Protection issues permits for business activities that may impact the
        state's air, water, or land. Numerous industries, including automotive
        repair, dry cleaning, manufacturing, printing, and others are tightly
        regulated by complicated environmental regulations.
      </p>

      <h4>Advertising Restrictions</h4>

      <p>
        Many communities in Illinois restrict advertising, regulate pricing, or
        require zoning permits. When planning your Illinois business
        registration, contact your city or county clerk for information on local
        restrictions.
      </p>

      <h4>Employee Requirements</h4>

      <p>
        If you have at least one employee, you are required to address the issue
        of employer insurance. Employees also trigger numerous tax requirements.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unemployment Insurance:</strong> You are required to make
          unemployment insurance contributions to the Illinois Department of
          Employment Security (IDES) if you have:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Employed one or more workers in each of 20 or more calendar weeks;
              or
            </li>
            <li>
              Paid at least $1,500 in total wages during the calendar quarter.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workers' Compensation Insurance:</strong> Under the Workers'
          Compensation and Workers' Occupational Diseases Acts, an employer is
          required to provide insurance for accidental deaths, injuries, and
          occupational diseases of employees arising in the course of
          employment. Temporary workers who normally do not receive company
          benefits are still provided workers' compensation. Insurance generally
          is purchased through private companies. Companies can apply to the
          Workers' Compensation Commission to become self-insured.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Local Tax Registration and Requirements</h4>

      <p>
        Some municipalities and counties in Illinois levy their own taxes in
        addition to the state and federal taxes that most businesses are
        responsible for. You should contact your local revenue department to
        determine if additional taxes apply to your business.
