            <h4>File Articles of Organization</h4>
            <p>Once we have verified your company name, incorporate.com will file your Articles of Organization. The Filing includes the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Illinois LLC Information:</strong> The Articles must include the LLC's name and address (a post office box or care-of address is not acceptable), purpose, and dissolution date, if there is one.</li>
                <li><strong>Members/Managers:</strong> You will need to indicate whether your LLC will be managed by members or managers. Your LLC must have one or more members/managers, and their names and addresses must be listed on the Articles of Organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Organizer:</strong> You will need to list the name and address of at least one organizer, and include a signature.</li>
                <li><strong>Registered Agent:</strong> An LLC in Illinois must list the name and address of a registered agent with a physical address (no post office boxes) within the state. The registered agent must be available during normal business hours to accept important legal and tax documents for the business.</li>
                <li><strong>Effective Date:</strong> The date on which the Articles of Organization become effective. This can be either the filing date, or a later date specified on the Articles. The later date cannot be more than 60 days after the filing date.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Provisions:</strong> You have the option of including additional provisions for regulating the internal affairs of the LLC.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your Illinois LLC has more than one member, you will need a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), even if it has no employees. incorporate.com can help expedite this step as well.</p>

            <h4>Register with the Illinois Department of Revenue</h4>
            <p>You are required to register your business with the Illinois Department of Revenue by completing the REG-1 Illinois Business Registration Application before you make any purchases, sales, or hire employees. Once you have filed your registration, the Department of Revenue will issue you a Certificate of Registration, which must be displayed in a prominent location at your business.</p>
            <p>The REG-1 form asks for comprehensive information about your company and its activities, including schedules that correspond to specific business activities, such as liquor information or cigarette and tobacco products information.</p>

            <h4>Annual Reports</h4>
            <p>Your Illinois LLC must file an annual report with the Illinois Secretary of State the day before the first day of the month that marks the anniversary of your initial filing. For example, if your filing date was April 10th, your annual report is due by March 31st. The Illinois annual report filing fee is $250.</p>
            <p>Only a member or manager is authorized to sign annual reports. Emailed or faxed signatures are accepted.</p>
            <p>If you need a filing extension, you may apply for an extended filing month. This becomes your anniversary for annual filing.</p>

            <h4>FAQs</h4>
            <p><strong>Do I need to reserve a name?</strong><br />
            When considering how to incorporate in Illinois, it is important to note that although Illinois does not require name reservation, doing so is a good way to ensure that your company name is and will remain available while you form your State of Illinois LLC.</p>
            <p><strong>If I incorporate in Illinois, do I have to locate my principal office in the state?</strong><br />
            No. Illinois permits a corporation's principal office to be located outside of the state.</p>
            <p><strong>Do I need to submit an operating agreement?</strong><br />
            No, you won't need to submit an operating agreement to form your State of Illinois LLC. Nevertheless, drafting your operating agreement is a critical step in forming your company, as it is a blueprint that you will use to govern operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Does Illinois have publication requirements or other follow-up filings?</strong><br />
            No. Illinois does not require you to publicize your company's formation, and does not have follow-up filing requirements.</p>
