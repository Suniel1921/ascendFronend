      <h3>General Pennsylvania Incorporation Information</h3>
      <p>
        A corporation, which is considered a separate legal entity, has
        liabilities and legal rights. In the eyes of the court, it is seen as a
        person and, as such, it stands alone from its board of directors and
        shareholders. As a "person," a corporation has many of the same legal
        rights and responsibilities as a living, breathing human being. Many
        large companies with numerous employees choose to incorporate under
        either a C-Corp or an S-Corp corporate structure. Incorporating also
        allows companies to issue stock.

      <h3>How to Incorporate in PA</h3>
      <p>
        The first step which one must take to incorporate in Pennsylvania
        corporation is to choose a business name. This name will need to be
        unique, and it cannot be confused with any other existing entity. If you
        need assistance with choosing a corporate name, incorporate.com can
        research the availability, ensuring you do not choose a name that has
        already been claimed by another business. Once a business name has been
        selected, it must then be registered with the state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Articles of Incorporation and corporate bylaws must also be drawn up.
        The bylaws of your corporation should include the number of directors
        that will comprise your board of directors. Pennsylvania requires that
        there are at least three directors: a President, Treasurer, and a
        Secretary. Directors may be appointed or recruited, and all corporate
        directors must be a minimum of 18 years of age. They do not need to live
        in the State of Pennsylvania and do not need to be shareholders of the
        corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Articles of Incorporation must be filed with the State of
        Pennsylvania. These articles will include information about your
        business, such as the stated purpose of the corporation; the number of
        shares of stock that will be issued; the legal address of the
        corporation; the name and address of the registered agent; and finally,
        the name of the corporation itself.

      <h3>Additional Steps for Pennsylvania Incorporation</h3>
      <p>
        Pennsylvania is one of only a few U.S. states that require a business to
        publicly publish an announcement of a newly-formed entity. The intent to
        form a corporation must be published in two newspapers, one of which
        must be a legal journal. This requirement applies only to corporations
        and non-profits formed in the state of Pennsylvania.
