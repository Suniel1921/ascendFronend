      <h2>LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Many businesses begin as sole proprietorships, but very often, business
        owners realize that they may need more protection for business and
        personal assets. Forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) can offer a
        business entity legal and financial protection to itself and its
        members. Learn more about how to form an LLC in the state of
        Pennsylvania.

      <h2>General Pennsylvania LLC Information</h2>
      <p>
        An LLC creates a legal separation between your business and you. Unlike
        a sole proprietorship where a business and its owner are one and the
        same, an LLC will turn your business into a separate entity. An LLC
        designation in Pennsylvania ensures that business owners and
        organization members are not personally responsible for the debts a
        business incurs. For example, if a business that is structured as an LLC
        faces a lawsuit, the personal property, assets, and savings of members
        of the LLC cannot be attached to the lawsuit.

      <p>
        Once a name has been chosen, a Certificate of Organization must be filed
        with the Department of State. This certificate should include the exact
        names of who will be managing the company and its members. Pennsylvania
        requires an LLC to have one, or more than one, managers or members.
        Addresses of the manager or managers must accompany the Certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to filing a Certificate of Organization, Pennsylvania LLCs
        must also file a Docketing Statement with the State. This statement
        includes basic information about your business, including the name of
        your LLC, as well as the physical address of your LLC. According to
        Pennsylvania laws, a P.O. Box address is not an acceptable address. A
        Pennsylvania LLC must list an actual street or rural route as its
        address. As an alternate option, a Pennsylvania LLC can use a Commercial
        Registered Office Provider (CROP) address.
      </p>
      <p>
        ascendincorporate.com can file the Certificate of Organization and the
        Docketing Statement with the State on your behalf.
