      <h2>Forming an LLC in Ohio</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of requirements for businesses that plan on
        forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) there. If you decide to form
        an LLC in Ohio, incorporate.com will take care of all the details. We'll
        research the availability of your company name and help you prepare and
        file your LLC Organization and Registration with the Ohio Secretary of
        State. We can also take care of many of your company's follow-up needs,

      <h2>LLC Name Requirements</h2>

        Ohio requires Limited Liability Companies to have names that can't be

        liability partnership, limited partnership, or trade name. When you form
        your LLC with incorporate.com's help, we'll research your company name
        to make sure it meets Ohio's standards.
