      <h3>California Filing Requirements for Corporations</h3>
      <p>
        Forming a corporation in California requires several important forms to
        be filed with the state.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Articles of Incorporation:</strong> The first requirement is
          the Articles of Incorporation. In California, the Articles of
          Incorporation vary depending on the type of company you have – a
          general stock company, a close company, a non-profit, or a
          professional company. It's important to choose the correct form when
          filing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statement of Information:</strong> You need to file a
          Statement of Information within 90 days of forming your corporation.
          You will also need to file an annual report each year, along with the
          annual fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certificate of Good Standing:</strong> Once your forms are
          completed and received by the state, along with applicable fees, your
          company will receive a California Certificate of Good Standing. This
          can be used to register in other states where you do business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Forms:</strong> Filing annual taxes requires
          additional forms, such as the California W4 form and California state
          withholding forms. Business licenses will also require additional
          forms submitted to the local city or county.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Providing detailed and accurate information is essential for ensuring
        your incorporation goes smoothly. Many documents cannot be filed due to
        name issues, errors, omissions, or misstatements in the filings
        submitted to the state. Ensure your forms are accurate and complete. Let
        incorporate.com handle the heavy lifting – we have helped thousands of
        companies with their California filing requirements, ensuring that all
        documents are received by the appropriate office in a timely fashion.

      <h3>California Filing Requirements for LLCs</h3>
      <p>
        Forming an LLC in California also requires several important forms to be
        filed with the state.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>California LLC-1:</strong> The articles of incorporation for
          an LLC in California are called the California LLC-1. This document
          needs to be filed with the state to form your California LLC.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statement of Information:</strong> Within 90 days of forming
          your LLC, you will also need to file a Statement of Information
          providing more details about your company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual Updates:</strong> Annually, you need to provide the
          state of California with updated information about your LLC. The
          California LLC-12 and California LLC-12r forms allow you to do this.
          You must submit these forms each year with your annual LLC fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certificate of Good Standing:</strong> Once your state forms
          are filed and accepted, you will receive a certificate of good
          standing, showing that your LLC meets the requirements to be a
          recognized entity in California.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Licenses:</strong> Business licenses will require
          separate specific forms from the local city or county where you plan
          to operate. Filing annual tax returns for your company may require
          separate forms, especially if you do not choose to be taxed as a
          pass-through entity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
