      <h2>Cost of Incorporating in California</h2>
      <p>
        When you're preparing to open a business in California, it's natural to
        wonder how the cost of incorporating in California will be affected by
        fees, such as the California corporate tax or the California limited
        liability company (LLC) fee. The California corporate tax rate is a flat
        8.84%, which is comparable to other state incorporation rates. There are
        also exemptions, deductions, and other strategies to reduce that rate,
        and there are other significant advantages depending on the type of
        corporation formed.
      </p>

      <h3>California Fees for Incorporation</h3>

      <h3>California LLC Fees and Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        The LLC in California costs less than forming a corporation, but there
        are some fees and taxes to be aware of, including:
      </p>

      <h4>California LLC Fee</h4>
      <p>
        The CA LLC fee is $85, payable to the secretary of state. In addition, a
        California LLC fee is also due for the statement of information, a
        document that must be submitted within 90 days of LLC formation and
        carries a filing cost of $20.
      </p>

      <h4>California LLC Business Licensing Fees</h4>
      <p>
        LLCs in California are also subject to specific business licensing fees,
        which vary depending on the jurisdiction where you form and operate your
        company. A small business license will generally cost between $50 –
        $100, and you may need industry-specific business licenses for your LLC,
        as well.
      </p>

      <h4>California LLC Ongoing Costs: Annual Taxes and Fees</h4>
      <p>
        Having an LLC means you are also required to pay ongoing fees. The
        California LLC fee schedule includes a California LLC annual fee, which
        is $800 annually, and is due within 3.5 months of forming your LLC and
        then every April 15th thereafter. For tax purposes, a California LLC
        with a single owner is treated as a sole proprietorship while an LLC
        with multiple owners is classified as a partnership.
      </p>

      <h4>California LLC Tax Fee</h4>
      <p>
        The California LLC tax fee is based on the LLC's total income received
        from all worldwide sources.
