      <h2>Filing a "Doing Business As" (DBA) in California</h2>
      <p>
        When you're ready to set up your LLC or corporation in California, you
        may want to file a "Doing Business As" (DBA) designation for your
        company. This is useful if you plan to refer to your business by a name
        other than its formal legal name. A California DBA is also known as a
        fictitious business name in California. Many companies file a DBA in
        California to use a tagline or descriptive name, such as "The Best
        Burgers in Town."
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits of a California DBA</h3>
      <p>
        Under California law, sole proprietors, LLCs, partnerships, and
        corporations must file a DBA in California if they plan on using a
        different name in the course of their business. This can help keep
        personal names out of the company title or can be helpful when the
        company name implies multiple owners, like "Jones & Partners."
      </p>

      <h3>How to File a DBA in California</h3>

      <h4>Step 1: Conduct a California DBA Search</h4>
      <p>
        The first step in filing a DBA in California is to perform a California
        DBA search. It's important that no other fictitious business names in
        California are similar or identical to yours. Additionally, the name
        must not be misleading or include terms such as "LLC," "Inc,"
        "Incorporated," or other words that carry specific business meanings.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: File the Appropriate DBA Forms</h4>
      <p>
        The next step is to file the necessary California DBA forms. These forms
        must include the exact, current legal name of your company and the
        principal place of business. For California LLCs, you must also provide
        the address used when forming the LLC.

      <h4>Step 3: Publish a DBA Statement</h4>
      <p>
        The final step in filing a DBA in California is to publish a DBA
        statement in a local newspaper within 30 days of filing your DBA
        paperwork. The statement must run once a week for four consecutive
        weeks. After the final publication, an affidavit must be obtained from
        the newspaper publisher and submitted to the county office within 30
        days of the final publication date.
