      <h2>Setting Up Your LLC or Corporation in California</h2>
      <p>
        Setting up your LLC or corporation in California involves choosing a
        business name and filing a "doing business as" (DBA) in the state. It's
        important to choose your name carefully, not only for your brand but
        also to ensure you meet California naming rules. This process involves
        doing a California LLC search or a California corporation search for
        your intended name. Need help establishing your corporation or LLC in
        California? <strong>ascendincorporate.com</strong> is here to assist. We've
        helped thousands of companies establish themselves in California, and
        we'll guide you through each step. <strong>Contact us today!</strong>

      <h3>
        Using a California Corporation Search to Choose Your Corporation Name
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you're ready to form your corporation in California, the first step
        is to conduct a California corporation lookup to make sure your chosen
        name is not already in use. The requested corporation name will be
        checked against other California corporation names (but not LLCs). A
        name will not be approved if the California state corporation search
        reveals another corporation with the same or a very similar name, or if
        the name is deemed misleading to the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ascccendincorporate.com</strong> can handle the California corporation
        search for you quickly and easily. We will send the required{" "}
        <strong>Name Availability Inquiry Letter</strong> to the Secretary of
        State to ensure that your company name is available. Once your name has
        been shown to be available in the California corporation search, we can
        reserve it for you. For a small fee, incorporate.com will submit a{" "}
        <strong>Name Reservation Request Form</strong> to the state, reserving
        your name for 60 days.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you choose to form your entity while speaking with one of
        our formation specialists, a name reservation is not required. The
        company name will be yours as soon as the state finalizes the paperwork
        we submit on your behalf. After the search of California corporations is
        complete, we will proceed with filling out the Articles of Incorporation
        and other paperwork. The state will conduct its final review of your
        corporate name when we file your company's formation documents.

      <h3>Using a California LLC Search to Choose Your LLC Name</h3>
      <p>
        Searching for and reserving an LLC name in California is a similar
        process to that of a corporation. A California LLC search is required,
        comparing your requested LLC name against other California LLCs (but not
        corporations). A name will be approved if the California LLC lookup
        reveals no other LLCs with the same or closely similar names, and if the
        name is deemed not misleading to the public.

      <p>
        <strong>incorporate.com</strong> can assist you with the CA LLC search
        and name reservation process. We will submit the required{" "}
        <strong>Name Availability Request Form</strong> and follow up with the{" "}
        <strong>Name Reservation Request Form</strong> to help you reserve your
        name. After completing the California state LLC name search and
        reserving your name, the state will perform a final review when your LLC
        documents are filed.

      <p>
        It is important not to order signs, stationery, or make other
        significant name-based expenditures before the California state
        corporation or LLC name search is complete. Ensuring the entire process
        is followed will prevent any unexpected changes.{" "}
