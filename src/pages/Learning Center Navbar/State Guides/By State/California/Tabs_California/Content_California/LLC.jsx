      <h2>Why Form an LLC in California?</h2>
      <p>
        A California LLC, or Limited Liability Company in California, has a
        number of advantages. The California LLC structure limits your liability
        for the LLC to the total of your investment in it. This means that your
        personal assets are protected from any business liability. For tax
        purposes, a California LLC with a single owner is treated as a sole
        proprietorship while an LLC with multiple owners is classified as a
        partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
        A California LLC also allows "multi-tiered ownership", where an S
        Corporation or a C Corporation can be part of the ownership group of the
        LLC. This allows for tax benefits and increased liability protection.
        Finally, the members' share of the bottom-line (net) profit of an LLC in
        California is not considered earned income, and is therefore not subject
        to self-employment taxes. Guaranteed payments from the LLC to members do
        represent earned income. You can choose each year whether you want your
        LLC to be taxed as a "pass-through" entity or as a corporation,
        depending on which is most beneficial.

      <h2>How to Set Up and Form an LLC in California</h2>
      <p>
        Forming your business can be overwhelming, especially with the number of
        forms and requirements involved. Fortunately, incorporate.com will walk
        you through every step of how to start an LLC in California and ensure
        nothing is missed.

        To register an LLC in California, the first step is to choose a name.
        It's important to have a name that isn't already in use, or too similar
        to an existing name. incorporate.com will search the databases for you,
        and then reserve your name in the California LLC system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step in starting an LLC in California is to file the California
        LLC forms. The Corporation Company helps you file California LLC forms
        to start your business as well as forms required for ongoing reporting,
        including the California LLC 12. We will complete and submit the
        articles of incorporation, or California LLC-1, based on the information
        that you enter on our website. We make sure it is filed correctly so you
        can get your business up and running right away.

        If you are looking to register an LLC from another state that is doing
        business in California, then you may need to qualify that LLC in CA.
        incorporate.com can file the paperwork to qualify in California by
        completing the California LLC-5 with the information that you provide to
        us on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your LLC has more than one member, it is strongly recommended that
        you develop a strong LLC Operating Agreement, although it is not
        required by law for California LLC formation.
