      <h2>Why Incorporate in California?</h2>
      <p>
        Incorporating your company allows you to protect your personal assets
        from any actions that might affect your business. It also gives you the
        professionalism of an incorporated company, making it more likely that
        others will choose to work with you. Business owners choose to
        incorporate outside their home state for many reasons. California is one
        of the most popular states for incorporation, because it has a thriving
        business community and offers important business benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        One major benefit of corporations in the state of California is
        management flexibility â€“ the state only requires three officer positions
        in the filing: president, chief financial officer, and secretary. You
        can even fill all three of these with the same person. This allows you a
        lot of flexibility when it comes to filling out your corporation's
        leadership team in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason forming a California professional corporation is a great
        choice is due to the anonymity of shareholders and management. The state
        only requires the director and resident agents to be disclosed, allowing
        stockholders to avoid having their names in the public record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, California corporation taxes are only 9%, with other
        significant advantages available depending on the type of corporation
        formed. Interested in California incorporation? ascendincorporate.com is here

      <h2>How to Incorporate in California</h2>

        Below is a brief overview of the steps to incorporating:
      </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          incorporation's bank account.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

      <h2>Small Business Owner California Sign</h2>
      <p>
        The first step to forming any business is choosing a name.
        ascendincorporate.com is happy to do this research for you, ensuring that no
        other companies in the state have the name you want to use. Then, we can
        file the paperwork to reserve the name for your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, the articles of incorporation will need to be completed.
        California requires three directors for a corporation unless shares have
        not been issued, in which case it can be one or two. In addition, if
        there is only one shareholder, there can be just one director. Two
        shareholders requires two directors. Three or more shareholders means
        your company should have three directors. The state does not have
        specific eligibility requirements for directors.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need a statement of information filed within 90 days of
        incorporation. You will also need a broadly stated corporate purpose,
        which will satisfy California filing requirements while also leaving
        your business open to pursue any avenue you choose. ascendincorporate.com is
        happy to help you complete all of these documents and help you draft
        your general purpose statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, you will need a registered agent listed in your California
        incorporation documents. This agent is the person that will receive
        legal documents on the company's behalf. Many companies use a service
        like ascendincorporate.com as their registered agent, to ensure all paperwork
        is received on time and forwarded discreetly and quickly to company
        leadership.
