      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        You can do several things now that will help you complete your Texas

        acquired a tax ID number from the IRS, then you should apply for one as
        soon as possible. They can be obtained easily through incorporate.com’s
        website. Without one, however, you cannot hire employees or file taxes
        for your business.

        advantages to owning LLCs, corporations, sole proprietorships, and other

      <h3>Which Texas Small Business License Do You Need?</h3>
      <p>
        The specific business license that you need in Texas can vary by
        location and industry. Before you start operating your company in Texas,
        incorporate.com can help you research and obtain the business licenses
        you will need.

      <p>
        In many cases, your Texas corporation will need to obtain a city license
        in addition to any state licenses and permits. Having a state of Texas
        business license ensures that you can operate according to the state
        government, but you also need to make sure that you meet all city
        requirements. Otherwise, you could find that you have unintentionally
        broken the law, which can lead to severe fines.
      </p>

      <h3>Do You Need Additional Texas Business Licenses?</h3>
      <p>
        You also need to know what types of Texas small business licenses you
        need for your industry. A business in the oil industry obviously needs
        different types of permits and licenses than one in the cattle industry.
        If your business needs to transport goods and materials over long
        distances, then you might also need a commercial driver's license.
      </p>

      <p>
        The situation can vary significantly from industry to industry. The
        situation can become complicated rather quickly. With incorporate.com's
        experience on your side, you don’t have to worry that you have missed
        any important license or permit required by state or local governments.
