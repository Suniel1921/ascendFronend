      <h2>Forming an LLC in Texas</h2>
      <p>
        If you plan to form a Texas LLC, then you will need to know how to
        prepare for the application process. incorporate.com will use the
        information that you provide to us and submit the Texas LLC application
        online to the Texas Office of the Secretary of State.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Texas LLC combines features commonly associated with corporations and
        partnerships. This type of organization, however, exists as a unique
        entity that can generally limit the liability of members to the amount
        of money they have invested in the company. Learn about Texas LLC
        registration below.

      <h2>Texas LLC Forms and Filing</h2>
      <p>
        In order to form a Texas LLC, you will need to file a Form 205
        Certificate of Formation for a Limited Liability Company. You should
        also have a federal tax ID number. incorporate.com can submit both of
        these Texas LLC filings on your behalf.

      <h2>Texas LLC Taxes, Fees, and Other Costs</h2>
      <p>
        The basic cost of filing for a Texas LLC certificate of formation is
        $300. This is a flat fee applied to everyone submitting the form. This
        is a one-time fee and incorporate.com will include that as part of the
        price for the LLC formation package that you select. Other services
        provided by the Texas Office of the Secretary of State may cost extra.
        For instance, if you wish to withdraw from a foreign organization, then
        you will need to pay a $15 fee to process the Certificate of Withdrawal
        of Registration. Contact incorporate.com if you need assistance with
        these Texas LLC filing requirements.

        You might also have to pay state, city, and county agencies for licenses
        and permits specific to your industry. These documents can differ
        significantly depending on the industry and the size of your
        organization.
