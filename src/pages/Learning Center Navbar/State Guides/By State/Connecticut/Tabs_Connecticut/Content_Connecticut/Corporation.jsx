      <h2>Corporation</h2>
      <p>
        Many companies decide to incorporate their businesses with protection in
        mind. A corporation is seen, legally, as its own separate entity. This
        protects the shareholders in that any debts incurred by the corporation
        belong to the corporation and not its shareholders.
      </p>

      <p>
        If any legal action is taken against the corporation, the action is
        taken against the corporation itself and its shareholders are not held
        liable. Thereby, their personal property is protected.

      <h2>How to Incorporate in Connecticut</h2>
      <p>
        Before you incorporate, you will need to select a business name and
        determine if that name is available. incorporate.com can search name
        availability for you. Once your name is selected, a decision must be
        made as to what type of corporation best fits your business, i.e.,
        should you choose an S corporation or a C corporation? In choosing the
        corporation type, there are tax considerations that need to be taken
        into account. If you make the wrong choice, your corporation could be
        double-taxed, which can impact profit. For a more detailed breakdown of
        the benefits of incorporating as a C corp or an S corp, please check out
        incorporate.com's respective guides.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you decide what type of corporation you are creating, you will need
        to select the individuals that you would like on your board of
        directors. Then, you will need to draft and file your corporation's
        Articles of Incorporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the Articles of Incorporation have been filed, you will need to
        obtain a business license and any other permits that might be required
        for the type of business you are forming. These permits can be obtained
        from the city or the county in which your business is located.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Considerations for Incorporating in Connecticut</h2>
      <p>
        Following the filing of the Articles of Incorporation, please be aware
        that additional procedures must be taken to comply with corporate
        requirements in the State of Connecticut. For example, the
        Organizational Meeting must be held within the first year of
        incorporating. Then, the Organization and First Report must be filed
        within 30 days of the Organizational Meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since you are operating a business, you may have employees. This means
        you will need to register on the federal level with the IRS for a tax ID
        number. You also may have to register as an employer at state and local
        levels, as well.
