        If you are hiring employees, when you apply for your Connecticut
        business license, you will also need a federal employer tax ID number
        (FEIN). Even though you are applying for a state business license, there
        are federal requirements that you will want to ensure that your company
        meets.

      <h2>Connecticut Business Registration</h2>
      <p>

        fines, or even shutdown. In addition to the benefit of satisfying
        obvious legal requirements, a business license also has the benefit in
        bolstering your reputation. Displaying your business license reassures
        your customers that you are a legitimate, dependable business.
