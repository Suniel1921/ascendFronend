        In order to form an LLC in Connecticut, you will need some knowledge of
        the state's application process. ascendincorporate.com can assist you in this
        process. Based on information you provide us, we will be able to submit
        your application to the Connecticut Secretary of State on your behalf.
      </p>

      <h2>Advantages to Creating a Connecticut LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Transforming your business or sole proprietorship into an LLC has many
        benefits. A chief benefit is that an LLC insulates business owners'
        personal property from company liabilities. In addition to asset
        protection, an LLC also offers "pass-through" taxation, which ensures
        that businesses do not have to pay taxes on profits. Instead, LLC
        members report profit and loss on their individual tax returns.
      </p>

      <h2>Forming an LLC in Connecticut</h2>
      <p>
        A company name must be chosen for your LLC in CT. This name must be
        easy-to-distinguish from other existing business entities and must also
        not be currently in-use by another business entity. The Secretary of
        State for Connecticut has a database of registered company names. The
        name of your business will need to be checked against this database to
        ensure it is not already in use. ascendincorporate.com will do this research
        for you and contact you in the event your business name has already been
        taken.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once your name has been registered, your business will need to appoint a
        registered agent in Connecticut who can accept legal papers on behalf of
        your LLC. This registered agent must reside in the state of Connecticut.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a registered agent is selected, the Articles of Organization
        should be drawn up. These will include information about your business,
        such as the industry you operate within, who will be running the
        business, and the names and locations of offices.
      </p>

      <p>
        ascendincorporate.com will help you compile the necessary information, provide
        you with templates for your business's Articles of Organization, and
        fill out the required forms to ensure everything is done properly.
        ascendincorporate.com offers 10 to 14 days average turnaround time from the
        day a customer submits his or her order until the filed documents are
        returned from the proper Connecticut authorities.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Requirements for CT LLCs</h2>
      <p>
        When forming an LLC in Connecticut, an employer identification number is
        required even if your business does not plan to hire employees. A
        Connecticut tax registration number is then required. There is a fee
        required to obtain your tax registration number from the state.
      </p>

      <p>
        All Connecticut LLCs are responsible for an annual $250 Business Entity
        Tax payable to the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services. In order
        to pay this tax, a Connecticut Tax Registration Number must first be
        obtained by filing Form REG-1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, your LLC must file an annual report with the Secretary of State
        in Connecticut. This report is due each year during the anniversary
        month of formation.
