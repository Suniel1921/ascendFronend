      <h2>Forming a Corporation in Minnesota</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of rules for businesses seeking to form a
        corporation there. If you've decided to incorporate in Minnesota,
        incorporate.com will take care of all the details. We'll research the
        availability of your company name and help you prepare and file your
        Articles of Incorporation with the Minnesota Secretary of State. We can
        also assist with many of your follow-up needs such as amendment filings,
        written consents, and annual report preparation and filing.
      </p>

      <h3>Corporate Name Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Minnesota requires corporations to have names that can't be confused
        with any corporate, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
        limited liability company, not-for-profit, or reserved names on record
        with the Secretary of State. When you incorporate with incorporate.com's
        help, we'll research your company name to make sure it meets Minnesota's
        standards.
