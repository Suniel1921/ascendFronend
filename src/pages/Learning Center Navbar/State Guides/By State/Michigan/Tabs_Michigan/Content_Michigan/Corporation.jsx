      <h2>Forming a Corporation in Michigan</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own set of rules for businesses seeking to form a
        corporation there. If you've decided to incorporate in Michigan,
        incorporate.com will take care of all the details. We'll research the
        availability of your company name and help you prepare and file your
        Articles of Incorporation with the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor,
        and Economic Growth. We can also assist with many of your follow-up
        needs such as amendment filings, written consents, and annual report
        preparation and filing.

      <h3>Corporate Name Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Michigan requires corporations to have names that can't be confused with
        any corporate, not-for-profit, assumed corporate, reserved or registered
        names on record with the Bureau of Commercial Services. When you
        incorporate with incorporate.com's help, we'll research your company
        name to ensure it meets Michigan's standards.
