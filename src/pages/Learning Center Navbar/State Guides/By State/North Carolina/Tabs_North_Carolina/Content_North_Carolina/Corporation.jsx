      <h3>Steps to Incorporate in North Carolina</h3>

      <h4>Select a Business Name</h4>
      <p>
        The first step to incorporating your business in North Carolina is to
        select an original name not already in use by another business in the
        state. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          North Carolina prohibits the use of a name if another corporation is
          already using it or one that is very similar. (An exemption may be
          made if you are able to obtain written permission from the other
          corporation already using the name.) If the name you want to use has
          been reserved (i.e., is not yet in use) by another company, you may be
          able to transfer the name to your company if the current users of the
          name agree.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name must include a corporate ending such as "corporation,"
          "incorporated," "company," or "limited," or the abbreviation "corp.,"
          "inc.," "co.," or "ltd." Note that these words will be disregarded by
          North Carolina's Secretary of State when determining if your proposed
          name is distinguishable from other names in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Secretary of State will also disregard articles, conjunctions,
          prepositions, punctuation, spaces, and the substitution of an Arabic
          numeral for a word when determining whether your proposed name is
          distinguishable from other names in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name may not contain language stating or implying that the
          corporation is organized for a purpose other than that indicated on
          its articles of organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          In North Carolina, there are certain words and phrases that cannot be
          used in a corporate name unless you have received permission from the
          proper legal authority, or you can provide documentation that proves
          you are legally qualified to provide the service indicated:
          <ul>
            <li>Bank, Banker and Banking</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Mutual</li>
            <li>Cooperative, Co-op</li>
            <li>Insurance</li>
            <li>Realtor</li>
            <li>Engineer, Engineering</li>
            <li>Architect, Architecture, Architectural</li>
            <li>Surveyor, Survey, Surveying</li>
            <li>Certified Public Accountant and abbreviations of such</li>
            <li>Wholesale</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        incorporate.com will do the necessary research to make sure your
        company's name meets the state standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can reserve a corporate name for 120 days for a fee of $30.00. The
        reservation is non-renewable.
      </p>

      <h4>Filing Articles of Incorporation in North Carolina</h4>

        <li>
          <strong>Optional Provisions:</strong> You have the option to include

          provisions relating to management and regulation of the corporation's
          affairs; provisions which define, limit, or regulate the powers of the
          corporation, its directors, and its officers; provisions defining the
          qualifications, rights, and responsibilities of its shareholders; and

      <h4>Other Requirements for Corporations</h4>

      <h5>
        Register with the IRS and the North Carolina Department of Revenue
      </h5>
      <p>
        If you intend to hire employees or open a bank account, you will need a
        federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). incorporate.com can help
        expedite this step as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can register your business with the North Carolina Department of
        Revenue by completing and submitting Form NC-BR, or by registering
        online. When you register, you will be issued an account ID number for
        such tax purposes as income tax withholding, sales and use tax, and
        machinery and equipment tax.
      </p>

      <h5>Officers/Directors</h5>
      <p>
        North Carolina corporations must have at least one director. Directors'
        names and addresses do not have to appear in your Articles of
        Incorporation.
      </p>

      <h5>Annual Reports</h5>
      <p>
        Every North Carolina corporation must file an annual report with the
        Secretary of Revenue in paper form, or with the Secretary of State in
        electronic form.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the paper form, the report is due when your income and franchise tax
        returns are due, and the fee is $25. If you request an extension to file
        a return, it will also apply to the annual report.
      </p>
      <p>
        The electronic form is due to the Secretary of State by the fifteenth
        day of the fourth month following the close of your corporation's fiscal
        year. The fee is $18, plus a $2 electronic filing fee.
      </p>

      <h5>Principal Office</h5>
      <p>
        Your corporation can be located outside of North Carolina. The principal
        office address is not required on the Articles of Incorporation, but
        must appear on your first annual report.
      </p>

      <h4>FAQs</h4>

      <h5>Do I need to reserve a name?</h5>
      <p>
        North Carolina does not require name reservation; however, it is a good
        way to ensure that your company name is available, and will remain
        available while you file for incorporation in North Carolina.
      </p>

      <h5>Do I need to submit bylaws?</h5>
      <p>
        No, you won't need to submit bylaws. Nevertheless, drafting your
        corporation's bylaws is a critical step in forming your company, as they
        are the blueprint that you will use to govern operations.
      </p>

      <h5>
        Does North Carolina have publication requirements or other follow-up
        filings?
      </h5>
      <p>
        No. North Carolina does not require you to publicize your company's
        formation, and does not have follow-up filing requirements.
