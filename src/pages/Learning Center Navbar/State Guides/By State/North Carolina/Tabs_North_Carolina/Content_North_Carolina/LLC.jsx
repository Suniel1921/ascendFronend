      <h2>Forming an LLC in North Carolina</h2>
      <p>
        If you decide to form an LLC in North Carolina, incorporate.com will
        handle the details. We'll research the availability of your company name
        and help you prepare and file your Articles of Organization with the
        Corporations Division of the North Carolina Department of the Secretary
        of State. We can also take care of many of your company's follow-up
        needs, including annual report preparation and filing.
      </p>

      <h2>Steps to Form a North Carolina LLC</h2>
      <h3>Select a Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to forming your LLC in North Carolina is to select an
        original name not already in use by another business in the state. Here
        are some things to keep in mind when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          North Carolina prohibits the use of a name if another company is
          already using it or one that is very similar. (An exemption may be
          made if you are able to obtain written permission from the other
          corporation already using the name.) If the name you want to use has
          been reserved (i.e., is not yet in use) by another company, you may be
          able to transfer the name to your company if the current users of the
          name agree.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name must include the words "limited liability company" or its
          abbreviation, either L.L.C. or LLC. It can also contain a combination
          of the words, such as "ltd. Liability Co." or "ltd. Liability
          Company." Note that these words will be disregarded by North
          Carolina's Secretary of State when determining if your proposed name
          is distinguishable from other names in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Secretary of State will also disregard articles, conjunctions,
          prepositions, punctuation, spaces, and the substitution of an Arabic
          numeral for a word when determining whether your proposed name is
          distinguishable from other names in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name may not contain language stating or implying that the LLC is
          organized for a purpose other than that indicated on its Articles of
          Organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          When forming your LLC in North Carolina, there are certain words and
          phrases that cannot be used in a business name unless you have
          received permission from the proper legal authority, or you can
          provide documentation that proves you are legally qualified to provide
          the service indicated:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bank, Banker and Banking</li>
          <li>Trust</li>
          <li>Mutual</li>
          <li>Cooperative, Co-op</li>
          <li>Insurance</li>
          <li>Realtor</li>
          <li>Engineer, Engineering</li>
          <li>Architect, Architecture, Architectural</li>
          <li>Surveyor, Survey, Surveying</li>
          <li>Certified Public Accountant and abbreviations of such</li>
          <li>Wholesale</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          You can reserve a corporate name for 120 days for a fee of $30.00. The
          reservation is non-renewable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you decide to set up your LLC in NC with incorporate.com, we will do
        the necessary research to make sure your company's name meets the state
        standards.
      </p>

      <h3>File Articles of Organization</h3>
      <p>
        Once we have verified your company name, incorporate.com will file a
        Certificate of Organization for your LLC. The filing includes the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>LLC Information:</strong> The form must include the exact name
          of the LLC with an appropriate company ending.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organizers/Members:</strong> At least one person must execute
          the Articles of Organization. Include the name and address of each
          person, and indicate whether each person is a member, organizer, or
          both. Each person listed on the articles will be required to sign the
          articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registered Office and Agent:</strong> The name and street
          address and county of a registered agent in North Carolina. The
          registered agent is the person to whom the state will send all
          official correspondence. The registered agent can be, but does not
          have to be, the same as your company's office address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Principal Office:</strong> If your LLC has a principal office,
          you must include the address (including the county). If the mailing
          address does not match your street address, include it as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Provisions:</strong> You have the option of including
          additional provisions, such as a statement for regulating the internal
          affairs of the LLC; the purpose or purposes for which the company is
          organized; provisions relating to management and regulation of the
          company's affairs; provisions defining member qualifications, rights,
          and responsibilities; and provisions limiting or eliminating the
          personal liability of any member/manager for monetary damages for
          breach of any duty as a member/manager.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Email Address:</strong> North Carolina offers a free voluntary
          notification system. If you opt to provide your email address, you
          will receive updates and reminders from the Secretary of State's
          office; the state is also using the information as a way to help
          prevent business identity theft.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effective Date:</strong> The date on which the Articles of
          Organization become effective. This can be either the filing date, or
          a later date specified on the certificate, up to 90 days after the day
          of filing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <h4>Do I need to reserve a name?</h4>
      <p>
        North Carolina does not require name reservation; however, it is a good
        way to ensure that your company name is available, and will remain
        available while you form your LLC.
      </p>

      <h4>Do I need to submit an operating agreement?</h4>
      <p>
        No, you won't need to submit an operating agreement. Nevertheless,
        drafting your LLC's operating agreement is a critical step in forming
        your company, as it is the blueprint that you will use to govern
        operations.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Does North Carolina have publication requirements or other follow-up
        filings?
      </h4>
      <p>
        No. North Carolina does not require you to publicize your company's
        organization, and does not have follow-up filing requirements.
