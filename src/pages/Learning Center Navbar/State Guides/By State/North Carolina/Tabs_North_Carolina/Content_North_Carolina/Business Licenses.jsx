      <h2>Get North Carolina Business Licenses</h2>
      <p>
        North Carolina does not issue a general state business license that will
        ensure that your company is meeting all state requirements. The state of
        North Carolina has more than 700 regulatory, state-issued, and
        occupational business licenses and permits, and many cities and counties
        also require licenses. Depending on what you do and where you plan to
        operate, your business may be required to have various state and/or
        municipal licenses, certificates, or permits.
      </p>

      <h2>North Carolina Business Licenses</h2>

        and permits companies need to operate in compliance. The directory is
        organized by these topic areas:

      <h2>City or Local Licenses and Permits</h2>
      <p>
        You may also need local licenses and permit requirements in North
        Carolina, such as privilege licenses, occupational licenses, and other
        miscellaneous licenses. These licenses and permits are expedited at the
        county level.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Privilege License:</strong> In North Carolina, all for-profit
          businesses located within city limits must have a privilege license
          before beginning business operations. In some cities, zoning and other
          related requirements must be approved before you can obtain a license.
          If the business is not located in a city, county privilege licenses
          may be applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zoning:</strong> The Zoning or Planning Department, city or
          county, determines if a business location is zoned correctly for the
          proposed business type. Some areas are not zoned for commercial
          businesses; you will want to make sure that your area is zoned
          appropriately for your business type. Some home-based businesses are
          required to have a Home Occupation Use Permit. In addition, you may
          live in a subdivision with Covenants, Codes, and Restrictions (CC and
          Rs), that are more restrictive than your city zoning requirements.
          Check with your homeowners association for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Signs:</strong> Sign sizes and locations are regulated within
          city or county limits and are determined by the Inspection or Planning
          Department. Contact the city or county prior to installing a business
          sign to ensure it meets the regulations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Employee Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        If you have at least one employee, you are required to address the issue
        of employer insurance. Employees also trigger numerous tax requirements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Health Insurance:</strong> The new national health care reform
          law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) requires
          employers to issue a Marketplace Notification to current employees by
          October 1st, 2013, and to new hires within 14 days of the employee's
          start date. The notification is to help employees to better understand
          health insurance marketplaces, compare health insurance plans, and
          enroll in coverage. North Carolina did not create a state-specific
          insurance marketplace, opting instead to refer residents to the
          federal HealthCare.gov marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unemployment Insurance:</strong> The Employment Security Law
          of North Carolina requires you to contribute to the state's
          unemployment compensation fund, which funds temporary unemployment
          insurance benefits to eligible workers. If you are a general business
          employer with at least one worker in 20 different calendar weeks
          during a calendar year, or with a payroll of at least $1,500 in any
          calendar quarter, you are liable for contributions under the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Workers' Compensation Insurance:</strong> If you have three or
          more employees, The North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act requires
          you to either purchase workers' compensation insurance or qualify as a
          self-insured employer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tax Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Your business may be required to pay different taxes in North Carolina,
        depending upon your type and size of business. Your tax requirements may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sales and Use Tax:</strong> If you are a retail or wholesale
          merchant, you need a Certificate of Registration, unless specifically
          exempt by statute. You can apply online by completing Form NC-BR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Franchise Tax:</strong> All corporations doing business in
          North Carolina must pay an annual franchise tax. The tax is calculated
          using the largest of these tax bases for your company: Capital stock,
          surplus, and undivided profits; 55 percent of appraised ad valorem tax
          value of all tangible property in North Carolina; or actual investment
          in tangible property in the state. The franchise tax rate is $1.50 per
          $1,000, and the minimum amount due is $35.
