          Department of Telecommunications and Energy (regulatory body for

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Health and Safety Regulation and Licensing</h2>
      <p>
        Massachusetts' Department of Labor Standards administers several
        workplace safety and health programs, and issues licenses to individuals
        and businesses that provide temporary employment services or perform
        lead or asbestos abatement work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department of Public Health regulates and licenses hospitals,
        long-term care facilities, home health care agencies, controlled
        substances, EMT/EMS, X-ray technicians and mammography, lead inspectors,
        meat, poultry, and shellfish processors, and nurse assistants.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the federal
        agency responsible for regulating workplace and worker safety.
      </p>

      <h2>Employee Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        If you have at least one employee, you are required to address the issue
        of employer insurance. Employees also trigger numerous tax requirements:
      </p>

      <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        The new national health care reform law (the Patient Protection and
        Affordable Care Act or ACA) requires employers to issue a Marketplace
        Notification to current employees by October 1st, 2013, and to new hires
        within 14 days of the employee's start date. The notification is to help
        employees to better understand health insurance marketplaces, compare
        health insurance plans, and enroll in coverage. In Massachusetts, the
        state marketplace is known as the Massachusetts Health Connector.
      </p>

      <h2>Unemployment Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        The Massachusetts Unemployment Insurance Law requires you to pay
        contributions into the Commonwealth's unemployment compensation fund,
        which funds temporary unemployment insurance benefits to eligible
        workers. If you are a private, for-profit employer, and you have people
        working one or more days in each of 13 weeks during a calendar year, or
        if you pay wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar quarter, you are
        liable for contributions under the law.
      </p>

      <h2>Workers' Compensation Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 152, ยง 25A, you are required to
        provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to all of your
        employees. Workers' compensation insurance pays for medical treatment
        related to injury or illness and also pays partial compensation for lost
        wages after the first five calendar days of total or partial disability.
        This requirement applies to all employees, regardless of the number of
        hours worked in any given week (except for domestic service employees,
        who must work a minimum of 16 hours per week in order to require
        coverage). Employers are required to notify their employees of the name
        of the workers' compensation insurance carrier. The Department of
        Industrial Accidents (DIA) is the agency responsible for administering
        the workers' compensation law in Massachusetts.
      </p>

      <h2>Tax Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        If you plan to sell products, you will need a Sales Tax Exemption
        Certificate. It allows you to purchase inventory or materials, which
        will become part of the product you sell, from suppliers without paying
        taxes. It requires you to charge sales tax to your customers, which you
        are responsible for remitting to the state.
