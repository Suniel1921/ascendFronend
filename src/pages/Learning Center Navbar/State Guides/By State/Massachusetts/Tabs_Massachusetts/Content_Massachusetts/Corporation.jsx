      <h2>How to Incorporate in Massachusetts</h2>

      </p>

      <h3>Select a Business Name</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to registering a business in Massachusetts is to select
        an original name not already in use by another business in the state.
        Here are some important considerations when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Massachusetts prohibits the use of a name if another corporation is
          already using it or one that is very similar. However, an exemption
          may be made if you obtain a letter of consent from the other
          corporation giving you permission to use a similar name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The words "Incorporated," "Corporation," or "Limited," or their
          abbreviations, must appear in a corporate name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name may not imply that the corporation is organized for a purpose
          other than that indicated on its Articles of Organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can reserve a corporate name for 60 days for a fee of $30.00 and
        extend the reservation for an additional 60 days for the same fee.
      </p>
