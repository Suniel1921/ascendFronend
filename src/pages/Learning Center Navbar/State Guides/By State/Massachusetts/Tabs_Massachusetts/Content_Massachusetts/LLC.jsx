      </p>

      <h3>Select a Name for Your Massachusetts LLC</h3>
      <p>
        The first step to forming your LLC in MA is to select an original name
        not already in use by another business in the state. Here are some
        things to keep in mind when choosing your name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Massachusetts prohibits the use of a name if another corporation,
          limited partnership, or limited liability company is already using it
          or one that is very similar. An exemption may be made if you can get a
          letter of consent from the other business.
        </li>
        <li>
          The words "limited liability company", "limited company", or the
          abbreviation "L.L.C.", "L.C.", "LLC" or "LC" must appear in the name.
        </li>
        <li>The name may contain the name of a member or manager.</li>
        <li>
          The name may not imply that the LLC is organized for a purpose other
          than that indicated on its Certificate of Organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can reserve a corporate name for 60 days for a fee of $30.00, with
          the option to extend the reservation for another 60 days for an
          additional $30.00.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        incorporate.com will do the necessary research to ensure your company's
        name meets the state of Massachusetts standards.
      </p>
