      <h2>LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Small business owners and sole proprietors may find that forming a
        limited liability company – or LLC – can protect their personal assets
        from lawsuits against your business. Forming an LLC can also endow your
        business with an added layer of credibility, as well as provide
        "pass-through" taxation to members.

      <h2>Selecting a Business Name for a Georgia LLC</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've decided that an LLC designation is the right option for your
        business, you must select a business name. In accordance with Georgia
        law, the chosen business name should be eighty characters or less and
        this name must include one of the following words or abbreviations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited Liability Company</li>
        <li>Limited Company</li>
        <li>LLC</li>
        <li>LC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This name must not be able to be confused with another existing business
        entity. incorporate.com has a list of all restricted names and can
        assist you in this process. In the event your business name has already
        been chosen, we will contact you in order to select another name.

      <h2>Georgia LLC Operating Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        An operating agreement clearly defines the management and financial
        structure of an LLC, as well as the relationships with members and the
        percentage of the business that each member owns. The state of Georgia
        does not require an LLC operating agreement, but businesses – even those
        comprised of only one member – are encouraged to complete one. An
        operating agreement will give your LLC the credibility it needs to stand
        as a true limited liability company in case it is ever questioned in a
        court of law.
      </p>

      <h2>Georgia LLC Articles of Organization and Additional Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Articles of Organization must also be written and filed with the Georgia
        Secretary of State Office. These Articles include the names and
        addresses of all owners or "members" of the LLC. These Articles should
        be accompanied by Transmittal Form 231, which identifies your LLC's
        registered agent and location of your company headquarters. Transmittal
        Information Georgia Limited Liability form should also be included and
        filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Georgia LLC registration will also need to meet all requirements of
        the other tax and regulatory authorities of the state of Georgia. For
        instance, one of these requirements is that LLCs in the state of Georgia
        must inform the IRS and state of any new hires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once formed, there are additional Georgia LLC filing requirements in the
        form of an annual registration. This annual filing is required between
        the following January and April after the Georgia LLC formation.
      </p>

        do business within the state of Georgia, you must fill out an
