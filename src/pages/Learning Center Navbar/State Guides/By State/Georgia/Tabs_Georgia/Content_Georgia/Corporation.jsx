        General Georgia Incorporation and Business Registration Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        Corporations, regardless of size, must follow certain rules and
        regulations set forth by their state government. These regulations
        ensure the business is operating as its own entity outside of its
        owners. This includes the existence of a board of directors, board
        meetings, and carefully kept records of all business activities.

        There are advantages to incorporating in Georgia. These advantages
        pertain to investors and the corporate management structure. The
        management structure of a corporation includes officers, directors, and
        shareholders. Each of these groups has defined roles in a corporate
        setting. Structuring your business as a corporation allows you to issue
        stock. The ability to issue stock can help you better attract investors
        for your business, allowing you to grow and expand at a rate that might
        not be possible as an unincorporated business.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step to incorporating is choosing a business name. Your
        business name must include such words as "corporation," "company," or
        "incorporated" or an abbreviated form of those words.
      </p>

      <p>
        After choosing your name, you must be certain that your chosen business
        name is not already in use within the state of Georgia. It must not be
        too similar to any business name already registered. incorporate.com
        will research whether your chosen business name is already in use and
        will contact you if you need to select a new name.

      <p>
        Georgia is a state that requires corporations and non-profits to
        publicly publish its newly-formed entity. As a direct result of this
        state requirement, all Georgia businesses that intend to incorporate
        must publish their intent to do so in a newspaper that stands as the
        official legal organ of the county in which the business's primary
        registered office stands. There are several requirements that the paper
        must meet to qualify, which involve the size of its readership and the
        percent of its subscription rate. As part of our incorporation services,
        incorporate.com will automatically research the correct publication of
        record and publish this information for Georgia customers.
