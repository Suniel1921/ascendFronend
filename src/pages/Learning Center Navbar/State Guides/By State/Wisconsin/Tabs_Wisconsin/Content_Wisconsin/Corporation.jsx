      <h2>Forming a Corporation in Wisconsin</h2>

      <p>

        corporation there. If you've decided to incorporate in Wisconsin,

      <h2>Corporate Name Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        Wisconsin requires corporations to have names that can't be confused
        with any reserved or registered corporate names existing or dissolved.
        The name must also be distinguishable from any limited liability or
        partnership, cooperative associations, or fictitious names. When you
        incorporate with incorporate.com's help, we'll research your company
        name to make sure it meets Wisconsin's standards.
